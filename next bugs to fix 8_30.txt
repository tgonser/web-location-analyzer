## Summary: Distance/Duration Filter Bug Fix

**The Problem:**
Your distance threshold (e.g., 6000m) and duration threshold (e.g., 8000s) aren't working because the `unified_app.py` file has a stub implementation that doesn't actually apply these filters. 

**Where the bug is:**
In `unified_app.py`, the `LocationProcessor.process_file()` method (around line 236-243) just passes all entries through without filtering:
```python
# Simplified processing - in real version would call process_entry
processed_entries.append(entry)  # <- This adds EVERYTHING
```

**What needs to be done:**

1. **Copy the working filter methods** from `parser_app.py` into `unified_app.py`:
   - `process_entry()` - Routes to the appropriate processor
   - `process_activity()` - Filters activities by distance threshold
   - `process_visit()` - Filters visits by duration and probability thresholds  
   - `process_timeline_path()` - Filters timeline points by distance between points
   - `sample_points()` - Intelligent sampling of timeline paths

2. **Replace the stub loop** in `process_file()` with:
   ```python
   for entry in relevant_entries:
       processed = self.process_entry(entry, settings)
       if processed:  # Only add if it passes the filters
           processed_entries.append(processed)
   ```

3. **Test with your thresholds** (6000m, 8000s) to verify filtering works

The filters exist in `parser_app.py` but were never implemented in `unified_app.py`. It's essentially running without any distance/duration filtering despite showing those options in the UI.
